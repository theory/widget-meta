Widget/Meta version 0.03
========================

This class specifies simple objects that describe UI widgets. The idea is to
associate Widget::Meta objects with the attributes of a class in order to
automate the generation of UI widgets for instances of the class. At its core,
this class a very simple module that stores value and returns them on
demand. The assigning of values to its attributes and checking the validity of
those attributes happens entirely in the "new()" constructor. Its attributes
are read-only; the "options" attribute is actually a code reference, the
return value of which is returned for every call to the "options()" accessor.
